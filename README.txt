This database is super simple to set up and use.
the steps to using this is running the Phase3Setup.py script to create the DB file
From there if you would like to add filler data run the Phase3fillwithdata.py 
script to do that

lastly to use the database as a user run the Phase3Application.py script and then 
use the CLI prompts to interact with the database
